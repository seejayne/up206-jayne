# Week 3 Reading Assignment

[OSMnx: New methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309738462_OSMnx_New_Methods_for_Acquiring_Constructing_Analyzing_and_Visualizing_Complex_Street_Networks)

[Off the Gridâ€¦ and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design](https://github.com/yohman/up206a/blob/master/readings/boeing_off_the_grid_2020.pdf)

My initial reaction to learning about OSMnx was a mixture of curiosity, excitement, and a little confusion. While I haven't done any type of complex spatial data analysis described in the papers myself, I have been slowly learning the common tools utilized by urban planners. My background before coming to grad school was in designing consumer software applications and have grown so accustomed to using well designed tools for doing work in the tech sector. Confronted with the tools available to planners is so frustrating for me as a user experience designer. So when Geoff Boeing talks about how the current lack of consistent, easy to use research tools makes researchers' work gratuitously difficult, I can't help but nod in agreement. 

While it looks like the OSMnx tool produces some nice looking maps, it was a little bit difficult for me to understand a lot of the technical analysis that was happening in both articles. But I did find it interesting how the tool was able to analyze the network of streets across the country to see how gridded various areas are. I see a lot of potential for using the tool, but without having tried it myself, I have a difficult time understanding what I would be able to use it for. I am also wondering how this tool has been incorporated into other mapping services that provide time/distance estimations for consumers (such as ride sharing apps etc). I'm looking forward to learning how to use it on my own project somehow.

## Questions:
Are there more user friendly ways to utilize this tool outside of a coding environment? For instance, how sites like Walkscore easily visualize commute distances.

The author mentions the tool can be used as a sort of "scorecard" for the profession, what are some examples of other projects people have done where this is used to "score" different aspects of planning?
