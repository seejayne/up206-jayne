### Student-Led Mapping Locates Areas in Los Angeles in Need of Shade Equity ###

### Summary ###
This article highlights a few partnerships between the City of LA, Nonprofits, and Cal State LA. It's an example of how government data can be visualized by students and how this can be used by nonprofits who are working to advance environmental equity. In school, the students took a course where they saw local environmental concerns mapped out. Some of these students also continued with an internship at local nonprofits. Alfredo Estrada interned with a group called City Plants, which strives to create an equitable urban forest for everyone in LA. Estrada was able to visualize data related to tree plantings which then helped the nonprofit make use the data to better target their work. After building this foundation another intern, Cindy Chen, was able to build upon the work and continue to push it forward. 

### Reflection ###
This article was relatable because it features students, like myself, using spatial data to help advance equity. It was a great example of multiple entities collaborating and coming together with data to create tangible and lasting change for communities in Los Angeles. Of course, given that it was published by ESRI it is clearly also a promotional case study for their proprietary product ArcGIS. I would be interested to see other examples of projects that use open source platforms like the ones we will be using in class. As a user interface designer I often find the Esri product UI to be very clunky and dated so I'd like to see more examples of spatial data visualized with good design.
