# Mapathon

For the mapathon I attended two workshops, mapping with Tableau and Intro to QGIS. I thought it was interesting to see how the different tools approached mapping compared to the way we've been doing it in class with Python so far. 

## Tableau
The Tableau process seemed the most user-friendly and approachable. We made two maps, one that showed the public wifi spots and the houshold incomes. I liked this map the best mainly because it looks so nice and clean. You can see it on [my Tableau page here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jayne.vidheecharoen#!/vizhome/librarywifi/librarymap). The second map brought in public data to show where students lived and visualize their proximity to the libraries around town. We also created a dashboard view so when the user clicks on a library location it loads the library website in another panel on the dashboard. The end result of this one was less appealing visually but I did appreciate learning how this functionality works and and could see how it might be used in an interesting way later. The main downside to Tableau for mapping seemed to be the limited number of layers that could be combined. 

## QGIS
Later on in the day I attended the QGIS workshop which was did a good job of showcasing the power of a dedicated GIS tool. But it felt much less modern and friendly than Tableu, and seems like a lot of the workflows are likely just modeled after the ArcGIS flow. A lot of the steps didn't seem very intuitive, and towards the end of the workshop I had a strange bug where the [checkboxes for my layers disappeared](https://i.snipboard.io/ULJVSK.jpg) and I wasn't able to get to the final product. But I liked the premise of the workshop, filtering listings based on a specific criteria (proximity to grocery stores and campus) and also learned about scraping data and using the [IDRE tool to geocode addresses](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/tools/geocoder/), which I think will be super useful in the future as well.
