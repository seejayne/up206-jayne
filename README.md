## Jayne Vidheecharoen ##
Hello. I'm a 2nd year MURP student at UCLA, focused on Design and Housing. I also have a background in UX/UI with some previous experience coding various little things here and there. 

### Some project ideas for class ###
- Mapping investments in differnt neighborhoods over time
- Mapping distribution of COVID related funding to small businesses
- Mapping affordable housing properties in Los Angeles
- Mapping things related to rent

### Objectives ### 
Ultimately, I'm interested in working on tools for Urban Planners and hope this class will get me one step closer to being able to build something out myself.
